# MIAW LM13700 based Dual VCA

A simple VCA based on the LM13700 using a schematic from Kristian Bl√•sol's Modular In A Week [youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyE56WXw0_5Q5QGMEXWmskuhojKyRdA3T).

I haven't made any changes to the circuit, I just drew up a stripboard layout to use.  The two pin connector in the center of the board is ground.
