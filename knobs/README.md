# Knobs

Various knobs I've designed to use.

##6mm knob - two piece
I've designed this to be printed on a SLA resin printer in two parts.  The inner "Knob Insert" I print in 100% Siraya tenacious flexible resin, the outer "Knob Body" I print in any normal resin.  This two part approach allows the insert to flex and fit even smooth shafts tight enough to not slip, while the hard body gives a normal knob feel and compresses the flexible insert to assure a tight fit on the shaft.
