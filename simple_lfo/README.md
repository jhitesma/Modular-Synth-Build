# Simple LFO

Another one I had a hard time tracking down an original source for.  There are lots of stripboard layouts for this circuit but I wasn't able to find an original schematic.  I did find one [here](https://imgur.com/a/SjuDHjW) which was reverse engineered from a stripboard layout.  This is commonly called a "Roland M100 LFO" But looking at the actual Roland schematics I'm at a loss as to why.  There may be some inspiration drawn from them and then GREATLY simplified...but it's definitely NOT a Roland clone.
