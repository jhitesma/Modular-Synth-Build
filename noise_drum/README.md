# Noise Drum - Snare and Hi-Hat

I found various stripboard layouts for this circuit but had a heck of a time tracking down the orignal schematic as the site it came from was gone.  I'm including that original schematic here since it was so hard to track down.

I redrew my own stripboard layout in DIYLC mostly because I wanted to add a 10 pin eurorack power connector.  I actually built the circuit twice on one stripboard due to a happy accident where I initially built it mirrored due to being inexperienced at working with stripboard.  But that just made it easier to have a snare and hi-hat in one module.
